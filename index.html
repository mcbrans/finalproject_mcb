      <h1>Your Climate Challenge</h1>
      <h2>What <span>you</span> can do for the environment!</h2>
          <p>The planet is heating up. Although some people deny the idea of climate change, fact is that we are confronted with more severe weather conditions, such as flooding, water shortage, heat stress and more tornados. If we don't reverse the impact of climate change, that will have great influence on our daily lives and social stability in the world.</p>
          <p>In 2016 almost 200 nations entered into the Treaty of Paris, with the goal to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius in 2100 compared to the pre-industrial age. Minimal action has been taken since then, Mr Trump has announced he will withdraw from the Treaty. You might think, if a country as big as the US is no part of the game, what can I do?</p>
          <p><span>You</span> can do a lot for the environment!</p>
          <p>Every person can contribute to reverse the effects of climate change, and the bigger the group gets, the greater the impact is. It is also a mindset to inspire your family and friends. No ideas of what you could do? Here we step in. This website provides you some of our best options of what you can do for the environment. Your very own personal Climage Challenge!</p>
